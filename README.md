# EchoR
It is a echo Unix-like command Rust version.
This version is based to an exercise made reading the book:
   
> Command-line Rust - a project-based primer for writing Rust CLI  
> Author: Ken Youens-Clark  
> Edited by O'Reilly.  

The echo command has other arguments and I intend to implement all this arguments functionalities.
